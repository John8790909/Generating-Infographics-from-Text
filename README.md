# Generating Infographics from Text
BSc (Hons) Computer Science | Yr 3 Lvl 6 - Project

An automated-based application that allows user(s) to enter a search query on an interactive form and generates some form of informational graphic.

## :page_facing_up: Description
GIFT is scripted in the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language at the back-end server-side. 
It's presented and deployed in a webpage using simple micro web framework [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/),
structured in [HTML5](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss) and styled with [CSS3](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/htmlcss)


This application supports:
  * Python version 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8
  * Flask version preferable 1.0+
  * NLTK version 3.5



## :wrench: Installation Setup
Using Python Package Manager (PIP), you will need to install the following on your machine's CLI (_Command Prompt / Terminal Window_): 

  * `pip install Flask`

  * `pip install nltk`

  * `pip install wordcloud`


## :paperclip: Notes
  - Both `Python` and `pip` must be pre-installed too - [`Python 3.4+`](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-340/) by default comes with the [`pip`](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/) install manager
  - `wordcloud` depends on  `numpy` and `pillow`. For more information on this module, please visit: <https://pypi.org/project/wordcloud/>
